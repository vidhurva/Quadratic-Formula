# Quadratic-Formula
// This C++ program computes the roots based on the quadratic formula.
// I used a series of nested if and else if statements to denote whether there are 2, 1, and no real roots. 
// Additionally, if your input for a = 0, then the program computes to the user that the function is not quadratic.
